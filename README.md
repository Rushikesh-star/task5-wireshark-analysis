# Task 5 - Network Traffic Capture and Analysis (Wireshark)

## Objective
Capture live network packets and identify basic protocols (HTTP, DNS, TCP, ICMP) using Wireshark.

## Steps Performed
1. Installed and launched Wireshark on Kali Linux.  
2. Selected active network interface (eth0/wlan0).  
3. Started live packet capture.  
4. Generated traffic by browsing websites, pinging servers, and accessing HTTP resources.  
5. Stopped capture after 1 minute.  
6. Applied protocol filters: http, dns, tcp, icmp.  
7. Identified and analyzed at least 4 protocols.  
8. Exported capture as .pcap file for submission.  

## Protocols Identified 
- *DNS:* Resolves domain names to IP addresses.  
- *TCP:* Reliable transport protocol ensuring ordered data delivery.  
- *ICMP:* Used for diagnostic purposes such as ping to test connectivity.  

## Deliverables
- Screenshots of packet captures for each protocol.  
- .pcap file containing captured traffic.  
- Short report summarizing identified protocols.  

## Tools Used
- Kali Linux  
- Wireshark
